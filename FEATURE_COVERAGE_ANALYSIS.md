## Conclusion

The TaxiApp has a solid foundation with comprehensive Backend APIs for core functionality and a modern, feature-rich Frontend. The primary gap is the integration of sophisticated ML capabilities developed by the Data Team. 

**Key Recommendation**: Prioritize integrating the Flask ML API with the Express Backend to unlock advanced features like AI-powered trip scoring and predictive hotspot analysis, which would significantly enhance the driver experience and operational efficiency.

**Estimated Integration Effort**: 2-3 weeks for high-priority ML integrations with proper testing and monitoring.
